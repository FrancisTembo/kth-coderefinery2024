# Ingredients:

## For the sopes:
2 cups masa harina (corn flour, like Maseca) SDSAJKDJSAKHLFC
1 1/4 cups warm water (adjust as needed) DFLASLDFKJASÖD
1/4 teaspoon salt
Oil for frying (vegetable oil or any neutral oil)

## Toppings (choose your favorites):
Refried beans (pinto or black beans)
Shredded lettuce or cabbage
Queso fresco (crumbly Mexican cheese)
Mexican crema or sour cream
Salsa (green or red)
Avocado slices
Shredded chicken, beef, or pork (optional for meat lovers)
Pickled jalapeños or radishes (optional for extra flavor)

# Instructions:

## Prepare the masa dough:
In a large bowl, combine the masa harina and salt. Slowly add the warm water and mix with your hands until you form a smooth, soft dough. The dough should be moist but not sticky; if it feels dry, add a little more water.
Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes.
Shape the sopes:
Divide the dough into 10-12 equal balls (about the size of a golf ball).
Take each ball and flatten it using your hands or a tortilla press until it’s about 1/4 inch thick and 4 inches in diameter. You can press it between plastic wrap or a ziplock bag to prevent sticking.
Cook the sopes:
Heat a dry skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
Cook each sope on the griddle for about 1-2 minutes on each side, until they develop light brown spots and are mostly cooked through.
Remove from the griddle, and while they are still warm, pinch up the edges around the perimeter to form a rim (this will help hold the toppings). Let them cool slightly.
Fry the sopes:
Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Fry the sopes in batches until they’re golden brown and slightly crispy on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
Assemble the sopes:

## Spread the base:
Spread a layer of refried beans on the bottom of each sope. This will be your base layer.
Add toppings:
Top with shredded meat (if using), lettuce or cabbage, queso fresco, and avocado slices.
Drizzle with Mexican crema or sour cream and your favorite salsa for an extra kick.
Garnish:
Garnish with pickled jalapeños, radishes, or any other toppings you like.

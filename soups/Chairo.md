## Ingredients
- 500g beef (preferably with bones)
- 2 cups chuño (dried, frozen, and rehydrated potatoes)
- 1 cup peeled and diced potatoes
- 1/2 cup wheat kernels (mote)
- 1/2 cup dried peas
- 1 large carrot, diced
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 2 liters beef broth or water
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
- Salt to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the chuño**:
   - Rinse the chuño well under cold water, then soak it in water for a couple of hours. After soaking, chop it into small pieces.

2. **Cook the meat**:
   - In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the beef and brown it on all sides. Once browned, add the garlic, cumin, and onion, cooking until the onion becomes translucent.

3. **Add the broth**:
   - Pour the beef broth (or water) into the pot, then add the wheat kernels (mote) and dried peas. Simmer the soup for about 30-40 minutes, or until the wheat and peas begin to soften.

4. **Add the vegetables**:
   - Add the carrots, diced potatoes, and chuño into the pot. Continue to cook until all vegetables and chuño are tender, about 20 minutes.

5. **Season the soup**:
   - Add salt and pepper to taste, adjusting seasoning as needed.

6. **Serve**:
   - Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with fresh parsley, and enjoy your traditional Chairo!
